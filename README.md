# Unity Mod Manager
This client is forked from the [**unity-mod-manager by newman55**](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) and was specifically redesigned to work for some games.


### Credit:
 - The original code was created by [newman55](https://github.com/newman55) and other contributors who commited changes to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager)
